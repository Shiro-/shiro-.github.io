              <h2>Description (Excerpt from final report)</h2>
              <p>Cardiac auscultation is the act of making medical diagnoses through listening to sounds
                within the body. There has been a notable lack of cardiac auscultation skill proficiency
                in new medical graduates. This lack of skill can result in unnecessary tests for patients
                with normal results and potentially missed diagnoses and treatment in patients with cardiac
                disease. A key barrier to skills acquisition is insufficient practice time to develop the core
                ability to differentiate normal from abnormal heart sounds. This paper introduces a serious game
                mobile application that is designed to utilize repetition and real heart sounds to improve skill
                competency in new healthcare professionals.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The basic objective of the prototype requires the player to distinguish between normal
                  and abnormal heart sounds. The player listens to the heart sound and is first asked to
                  answer the question “Is this healthy?”. If the player answers correctly, they are awarded
                  a point. If the heart sound does not indicate a healthy heartbeat, the player is then
                  prompted to determine what type of atypical heart sound is represented, such as a murmur.
                  The application integrates both audio and video. The heart sounds are played, and there
                  are sound effects that help reinforce the reward of getting the correct answer. As for
                  the visual component, the heart image moves to represent the motion of the heart and
                  complement the audio track. The presence of audio and visual feedback to integrate both
                  sight and sound as well as the ability to incorporate timing references improved the
                  learning value of the prototype.</p>
