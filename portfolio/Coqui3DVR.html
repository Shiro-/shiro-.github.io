              <p>The overall purpose of the project was to create a virtual reality (VR) demo using Unity.
                The final outcome of this project was to be a proof of concept demo for a serious game that
                simulates a type of cardiovascular surgery. The game was built and compiled for Android mobile
                devices for use with the Google Cardboard VR device. The main theme of the game is a surgery scenario
                which allows the player to experience the process of stent placement during angioplasty.

                The key goal of the client was to propose VR as an alternative to traditional and expensive surgical
                training. The client would like to produce a proof of concept for a serious game regarding surgical training
                that utilizes virtual reality. This project is intended to demonstrate the value of virtual reality
                technology for surgical training and serve as a pitch for a similar project of larger scope.</p>
